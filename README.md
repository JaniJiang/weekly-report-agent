# Weekly Report Automation Agent

This project demonstrates an **automated weekly report generation system**.  
It replaces manual data analysis by reading Excel files, extracting KPIs, generating charts, and outputting structured business summaries.  
The system has already been deployed internally as an **Agent workflow**, enabling analysts to interact with it through natural language dialogue.
